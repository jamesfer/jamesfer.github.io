  <p>
    I'm a Data Engineer with 5 years experience, currently living and working in Melbourne,
    Australia. Handling and serving data for high performance applications is what really interests
    me and I'm always looking for new technologies to explore.
  </p>

  <p>
    At REA Group, I'm building new data pipelines for business critical streaming datasets using
    Kafka and Flink. I'm helping the team design well architected services that encourage data
    correctness and safety. At the same time, we're exploring new techniques as a team such as
    schema powered APIs and in-depth data quality monitoring.
  </p>

  <p>
    Supporting and uplifting other team members is very important to me. I've helped onboard many
    developers of different skill levels, timezones and language backgrounds, and provided mentoring
    in our best-practices, all while working remotely. I also run the introductory Elasticsearch
    training at REA which is becoming a lot more popular as teams begin to depend on Elasticsearch
    for more critical services.

  <p>
    Outside of work, I love to tinker with code. Over the years I've created many experiments such
    as a fluent query language builder for Neo4J's Cypher, or a new React style rendering algorithm
    that indexes individual elements to gain large speed improvements. More recently, I've been
    experimenting with developing my own functional programming language; mainly for the challenge
    as it isn't very useful for anything yet.
