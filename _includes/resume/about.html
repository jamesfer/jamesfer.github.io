  <p>
    I'm a Data Engineer currently living and working in Melbourne, Australia. Moving and handling
    data in high performance pipelines is what really interests me and I'm always looking for new
    technologies to explore.
  </p>

  <p>
    At REA Group, my current employer, I'm working to build their new data pipeline for critical
    streaming datasets. I'm helping the team design well architected pipelines that encourage data
    correctness and safety. At the same time, we're exploring new techniques as a team such as
    schema powered APIs and in-depth data quality monitoring.
  </p>

  <p>
    Supporting and uplifting team members is very important to me as it can make the whole team a lot
    more efficient. I have helped onboard many developers of different skill levels, timezones and
    language backgrounds to our team, all while working remotely. I also run the introductory
    Elasticsearch training at REA which is becoming more and more popular as we build new high demand
    features.

    Outside of work, I love to tinker with code. Over the years I've created many experiments such as
    a fluent cypher query language builder for Neo4J, or a new React style rendering algorithm that
    uses deep component indices to gain large speed improvements. More recently, I've been
    experimenting with developing my own functional programming language; mainly for challenge as it
    isn't very useful for anything yet.
