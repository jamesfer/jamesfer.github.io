  Keeping track of entry costs for multiple different competitions was proving to be quite a difficult task for the club to do, so I created this small app to make it easier. After entering all the members and adding them to their respective teams you can create a competition and specify which teams are attending. The entry cost will then be displayed on the accounts page based on the number of unique entries and the number of crossover (when a member is competing for multiple teams).
