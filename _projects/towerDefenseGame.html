description: |
  Plan your defense using a range of different towers each with their strengths and weaknesses and then jump right into the defense yourself covering your own weakspots and chasing down straggling enemies. Find which combinations of towers obliterate each types of enemies while commanding the battle from the frontline. How long can you survive?
